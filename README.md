# Nidhi-sContentCreator
This repository is fun, simple project that I started as a means to provide my partner with a companion to help her with her journey to becoming a Content Creator. It's still midway but I aim to create a RAG that can access different "recent" social media posts, vectorize them and use them to generate new content that is "trending" on social media platforms.

I have found the streamlit framework extremely easy to deploy light-weight and simple web UI interfaces, that work perfectly for this personal project. This application can be found live on their Community Cloud page, accessible through here: https://nidhi-scontentcreator-7eergwbnb3uotleg5uazvr.streamlit.app/
